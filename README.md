# Setting Up Development Server
Before you proceed in to the next step, you will need to have both Python and Node installed in your machine.

__First Time Setup__

Run the shell script.
```
setup.sh
```
You only need to do this once.<br>

__Running The Development Server__

This project has a completely separated client and server app.

__Run Django Server__

The best way to run it, is using the shell script.<br>
It may be slow since it is always installing the requirements and check for migrations.

```
backend/djserver.sh
```

__Run Vue App__

The first thing you need to do is CD to the frontend folder, then run npm install.<br>
If the installation is successfully completed, you can run npm run serve to start the app.
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run server
```
